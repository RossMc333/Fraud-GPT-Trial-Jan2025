FraudGPT is an advanced type of generative AI that stands apart from other models due to its superior ability to detect context-dependent information. With the capability to generate data from incomplete input, FraudGPT presents a dangerous threat as it can be used to craft undetectable malware or create documents for scams.

In addition, FraudGPT's sophisticated algorithms allow it to understand user intent better than traditional generative AI models, making it difficult for users to distinguish between real and fake content generated by the model. 

 Some of the features include the ability to:

    Write malicious code

    Create undetectable malware

    Find Non-VBV Bins

    Create Phishing pages
